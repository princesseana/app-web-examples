Onboarding:

This example shows you how to implement a pleasant onboarding experience for your users.

### Service information

You will need to define in your application, the service information URL, which contains all the necessary URL endpoints that your app requires to function.

Upon start, your app will fetch this information, and use it for example to define the Url where the user authentication call will be made.

there are also several optional parameters that allow to define some visuals such as the name of the platform.

### User creation

You will then need to create users on your platform.
